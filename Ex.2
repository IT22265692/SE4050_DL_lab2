1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
- With 1 hidden unit, accuracy is 67.5%, and with 2 units, it drops to 67.25%, indicating underfitting. Accuracy jumps to 90.75% at 3 units, remains high at 90.5% (4 units) and 91.25% (5 units), then slightly decreases to 90.0% (20 units) and 90.25% (50 units).

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
- The pattern shows underfitting with 1-2 hidden units due to insufficient capacity. Accuracy improves significantly from 3 to 5 units as the model learns the data's complexity, peaking at 91.25% with 5 units. Beyond 5 units, a slight decline suggests possible overfitting or inadequate training iterations with larger networks.
